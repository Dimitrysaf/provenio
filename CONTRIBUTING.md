# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help with Provenio. Every kind of contribution is welcome, big or small, and you do not need to be a developer to help.

## Ways to help

- **Report a bug.** Something crashed, looks wrong or does not do what you expected.
- **Suggest an idea.** A feature you miss, something that annoys you, or a better way to do something.
- **Ask a question.** If something is confusing, that is worth knowing too.
- **Translate.** Help Provenio speak your language.
- **Improve the docs.** Fix a typo, clarify a step, add something missing.
- **Send code.** Fixes, features, cleanups, refactors or design changes.

All of these go through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Dimitrysaf/provenio/issues) or pull requests. If you are not sure which, open an issue and we will figure it out together.

## Reporting a bug

The more of this you can include, the faster it gets fixed, but a short report is still better than none:

- What you did, step by step
- What you expected to happen, and what happened instead
- The app version (shown at the bottom of Settings) and whether it is a Release or Beta build
- Your platform and device (for example Android 14 on a Pixel 7, Windows 11, Fedora with Flatpak)
- Screenshots or a short video, if it is something you can see
- Whether it happens every time, sometimes or only once

For crashes, a log helps a lot:

- **Android:** `adb logcat -d | tail -n 300`
- **Desktop:** the terminal output from around the time it happened

Please leave out anything private from logs and screenshots, such as API keys, debrid tokens or add-on links that contain your account details.

## Suggesting an idea

Describe the problem you want solved and, if you have one, how you imagine the solution. Rough ideas are fine. There is no need for a full design.

## Sending a pull request

Pull requests of any size are welcome.

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change. Keep unrelated changes in separate pull requests when you can, since that makes them easier to review.
3. Describe what you changed and why. For anything visible, screenshots or a video help a lot.
4. Open the pull request against `main`.

If you are planning something large, like a new feature or a redesign, opening an issue first to talk it through can save you work, but it is not required.

You do not need every platform's toolchain installed. The project's builds run on GitHub Actions, and your change will be built and tested there before it is merged.

### Code style

- Follow the style of the code around your change.
- Keep comments short and to a single line.
- Use Material 3 components for UI.

### Using AI tools

This project is itself built with a lot of help from Claude, so contributions written with AI assistance are welcome. Please test what you send and make sure you understand it well enough to answer questions about it.

## Translations

The app's text lives in `composeApp/src/commonMain/composeResources/values-*/strings.xml`, one folder per language. To add or improve a language, edit or create the matching folder, using `values/strings.xml` (English) as the reference, and open a pull request. Partial translations are welcome; missing strings fall back to English.

## Be kind

Be respectful and patient with everyone, whether they are reporting their first bug or sending their hundredth pull request.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE), the same license as the rest of the project.
